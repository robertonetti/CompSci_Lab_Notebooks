# CompSci_Lab_Notebooks
This repository contains the practical exercises for the Computational Science course. It includes five Jupyter notebooks, each designed for a specific lesson, covering key topics in computational methods and scientific computing.  Students will use these notebooks during the practical sessions to apply theoretical concepts to real-world problems.
